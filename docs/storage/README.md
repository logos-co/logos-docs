# Welcome to Logos Storage

Logos Storage aims at being a resilient, decentralized and censorship-resistance storage layer for
the Logos stack. At present, Logos Storage provides a basic filesharing layer, not unlike IPFS or
Bittorrent, which allows users to publish and share files with one another.

Moving forward, Logos Storage will enable full provider and downloader anonymity, as well as
anonymous persistence. Check out [our roadmap](https://roadmap.logos.co/storage/roadmap/) for more details.

## Using Logos Storage

Logos Storage can currently be used in two main ways:

1. via the [Logos Storage UI App](https://github.com/logos-co/logos-storage-ui), which runs as a [Logos Module](https://github.com/logos-co/logos-storage-module). You can use the Logos Storage UI App to upload and download files over the Logos Storage network.
2. Programmatically, using [libstorage](https://github.com/logos-co/logos-storage-nim). See our [simplified libstorage tutorial](./libstorage-tutorial.md) to get a feeling for what can be done.
