# Code examples

Code in documentation includes:
  - One-line snippets embedded in text
  - Short examples that illustrate a single element
  - Longer, more complex examples that demonstrate how to use multiple elements or features together

- Code examples should be concise.
- Wrap lines at 80 characters.
- Create code examples for elements that are frequently used or hard to understand.
- Use backticks (`) for one-line code snippets. Use fenced code blocks (triple backticks) and language identifiers for longer examples.

    | Language identifier type | Example |
    |:---|:---|
    | Programming or scripting language | `js`, `python`, `go` |
    | Command-line commands | `bash`, `sh` |
    | Configuration files | `json`, `yaml`, `xml` |

- Before the code example, add a description to describe the context and purpose of the example.
- Indent every line of the code block by four spaces to group the code with the description paragraph.
- Use code comments only for explaining code logic or variables. Use comments sparingly.
- Place code comments above the line they describe.
- For longer examples, consider breaking the code into sections.
- Place expected output in a separate code block using the `text` identifier, or explain the output in the description.
- Refer to [placeholders](./placeholders.md) for guidance on using placeholders in code examples.
